        <h3 class="title"> The importance of IT in modern business</h3>
        <para class="myPara">Any business, big or small, all rely on IT to operate. Without it the business would ultimately come to a standstill.
            IT is needed to communicate with all stakeholders, internal and external. It also provides a business with a lot of data and insight. 
            From this a company is then able to develop its existing systems and processes to grow. The world has evolved from papaer to electronic and without the IT in place businesses 
            would simply fail to operate. It is therefore extremely important that businesses have strong cyber secuirty to protect their records and classifield information.
        <br>
        <br>
        <para>To make this possible a business must have an IS (Information services) team in place. These teams are generally made up of web developers and designers. 
            With the correct skillset in coding they are able to retrieve information input in to the website to generate new products. Most developers of a high level would be seamless
            in using web languages such as javascript, HTML and CSS. There are also various other languages that are used such as Python, PHP and much more.

            Before any project begins it is best practice to prepare and plan what you are going to do. A popular planning website that IT teams use is Trello. This allows
            them to map out their project and break it down in to individual smaller projects which will ultimately become the end project when all tied together and completed.
            By using trello boards everyone who is given access to it can see what other teams are working on, timescales and which areas need to be prioritised on over others.
            Alternatively, there is nothing wrong with a large wall and plenty of post-stick notes to map out your project.

            When working on a project it is best to try and remain as agile as possible. The digital landscape is constantly changing and updated systems and releases are regular.
            If you have a clear goal in mind and focus on this entirely it is possible that upon completion you may have found that the consumers no longer require what you have made, 
            or a competitor has beaten you to ther mark. Businesses are required to remain innovative to stay ahead of the game and avoid a failed project which costs businesses 
            millions.
        </para>

        <br>
        <para>Various factors will determine what systems and software you would consider using for your project. Is your project small or large scale? Who is your audience? What 
            devices do you want it to be accessible on? Do they need to have developers recruited who are specialists in javascript or python?  
            All these are examples of what businesses need to understand and decide before they begin their project. There are plenty of different systems that could be used
            when writing code such as codepen and visual studio code. Generally it is down to personal preference for what developers and businesses use.</para>

            94.5% of 10 million most popular websites use javascript and therefore most businesses will choose to use the javascript language as it is the most popular and desirable 
            in the tech world. An annual report from website github shows that javascript was once again the most popular language due to having the most amount of opened pull requests. 
            Alongside business powerhouses such as Facebook and Google also opting to code in javascript it implements the idea that it is the strongest language 
            to learn and code in, thus the reason why I have chosen to create this website using it.
            It works and compliments HTML and CSS and creates a more seamless approach to writing code and is generous with its outputs on a website. 
            For example web pages written in this technology allow users to:
            <ul class="myList">
                <li>input data and submit it without needing to reload the page</li>
                <li>animations can be activated by using mouse clicks</li>
                <li>allowing for interactive content such as music and videos. </li>
            </ul>
        </para>

            In 2018 GDPR regulations were updated for the first time in over two decades. Businesses had to move quickly to make sure that they were comnpliant with these regulations.
            This included making sure all the sensitive data they kept on customers and staff were securely stored and anything that was considered to not be needed was removed from 
            their databases. Businesses would also need to change the way they market themselves as no longer being allowed to opt customers in to markleting emails and dependent on 
            the size of the business this could of been a large undertaking to finish before the updated GDPR regulations went live. However it could be expected that if a business
            had a strong code behind they would only need to update certain things once and these would filter through to all other areas of the website. Another reason to have 
            a great team of developers working on any business and avoid any fines.

    <div class = "review">Review: Upon review of my consultancy website I am happy that I used visual studio code to write my 
            code in. The VS code application is easily accessible for junior developers and is free to 
            download and use. This then gave me the option  to continue with my website out of hours and preventing me from being limited to working on it at codenation. 
            Looking back now I would have used trello to map out my website beforehand. 
            This would have helped me break down what I needed to do in to smaller projects and give me a clear indication of 
            what I was working on and what I would be doing next. If I followed this planning I would have been able to 
            visually see where I was at and up to rather than going in without a clear plan which led to me changing things round a few times throughout the project.
            Overall I don’t think my website is very clearly a consultancy website. If I was to re-do it or add to my project 
            I would add additional pages that had an ‘about me’ section and pages that showcased other works I had done. 
            This would include test pages and images of these works. If I had this as a page it would then be easy to add more 
            examples to it as I completed future projects. To access these  pages I would have a sidebar on the left with the links that would 
            remain permanently in place whilst the right side would still be able to be scrolled on. The pros about my website is that it is very 
            accessible as everything is included in one page, streamlined and easy to read as I chose to use white text on a black background. 
            I tried to take inspiration from other websites such as ‘apple.com’ that has a sleek design.

        <div class = "review"> Copyright: As this website was created by my own original work my website would be automatically covered by copywright.
            Minus the images and text fonts that I used which I got from a 3rd party. In retrospect I dont think their is anything within my website that I wouldnt want anyone to steal
            for their own purpose however I would add a copywright symbal to my website to maker sure that whoever wanted to use it would contact me beforehand
            to ask for my permission. This would just let me know how and what it was being used on.
